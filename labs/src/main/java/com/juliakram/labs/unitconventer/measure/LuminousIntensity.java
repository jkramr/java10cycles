     * Original (1946): The value of the new candle is such that the brightness of the full radiator
     * at the temperature of solidification of platinum is 60 new candles per square centimetre.
     *
     * Current (1979): The luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation
     * of frequency 540Ã—1012 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction
     * of 1/683 watt per steradian.
